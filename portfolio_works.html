	<p style="font-family: fantasy;">What is meant by full stack development? Full stack development is the end-to-end development of applications. It includes both the front end and back end of an application. The front end is usually accessed by a client, and the back end forms the core of the application where all the business logic is applied.
	<br>
	<br>
	Full Stack Developers are responsible for designing and developing websites and platforms. They work with design teams to ensure that user interactions on web pages are intuitive and engaging.
	<br>
	<br>
	You will learn to use languages like HTML/CSS and JavaScript to create stunning, visually evocative web pages. You'll learn back end languages or frameworks, like Python or the MERN stack, to build the server-side infrastructure that allows webpages to function.
